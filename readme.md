### What is this?
The `moods` object here is designed to be used with a personal analytics project I'm building. They're meant to range on a scale from 1 (horrible) to 7 (great), and the emoji are for use with button labels.

It comes bundled with the exciting `mood-mirror` command line tool, which is executable when you install this library and which will help you navigate the fraught emotional landscape of your innermost soul.

Don't overthink it.
